# NeuralSampling.jl

Neural networks that perform sampling from probability distributions

## Overview

The goal of this repository is to implement several proposed methods to sample from probability distributions using neural networks. Currently, the only method that is implemented is from the paper:

> Lars Buesing, Johannes Bill, Bernhard Nessler and Wolfgang Maass (2011).
> Neural Dynamics as Sampling: A Model for Stochastic Computation in Recurrent Networks of Spiking Neurons.
> PLoS Computational Biology 7(11), e1002211.

## Installation

Install via the Julia package manager:

```julia
] add https://github.com/cJarvers/NeuralSampling.jl.git
```
